# Random Fun Facts

1. I was considering having a "Preload" screen that would appear the first time the widget was started. Its basic purpose would have been to check for Spotify authentication and prompt the user to authenticate, showing the main screen after authentication succeeded.

2. While testing the main info screen, I used a different image as a placeholder. While testing the Window widget, due to a now-removed parameter being set to False, the widget would for some reason cause Wayland to crash, hence the Pomni boowomp image placeholder. (Admittedly, it's possible that Wayland will still crash. I have to test more now that I have everything I figured was necessary done.)

3. This is not the first time I've made a thing like this. In my Python Plunder Chest repository, you can find an older (and messier) version of the widget. I'm not very proud of how that one was written...
